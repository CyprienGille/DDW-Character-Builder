This bonus increases as you level (+3 at 9th level, +4 at 16th level).\n- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\nOnce you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, 6 at 17th, and an unlimited number of times at 20th."
